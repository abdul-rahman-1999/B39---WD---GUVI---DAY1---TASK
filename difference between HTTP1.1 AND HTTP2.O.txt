The difference between HTTP1.1 AND HTTP2

HTTP introduced in year of 1991,

HTTP is the foundation of data communication for world wide web.
HTTP is based on client/server model. client (receiver of service) and server (provider of service). That are communication Via requests and responses.

HTTP1.1 : 

It introduced in a year of 1997,

HTTP1.1 has three (3) TCP connections and It supports connection reuse. (example) for every TCP connection there could be multiple requests and responses, and pipelining where the client
can request several resources from the server at once. However, pipelining was hard to implement due to issues such as head-of-line blocking and was not a feasible solution. It Introduces
a warning header and error reporting is quicker and more efficient. The HTTP1.1's Authentication Mechanism is secure since it uses digest authentication, NTLM authentication.HTTP/1.1
provides faster delivery of web pages and reduces web traffic as compared to HTTP/1.0.

HTTP2.O : 

It introduced in a year of 2015,

Main goals of implementing HTTP2.O is for High level Compatibility, Page load speed improvements compression or request headers request Multiplexing over a single TCP connection etc.
HTTP2.0 has single TCP connection and it compress a large amount of header frames. It uses a Hpack specification as a simple and secure Approach to header compression. Both client and
server maintain a list of headers used in previous request.
The improvements of HTTP2.0 is no more head of line blocking. Single TCP connection itself service multiple HTTP requests by Multiplexing.
HTTP2 utilize multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time by a greater margin along with less sensitive to network delays.
